… Alright
Coffee cup, cold and black
Wish it had a little shot of Jack
Besides that, can't complain
Just tryna do the dang thing
Might change the oil in my truck
I ain't paying no thirty-five bucks
Kids need shoes, mama needs Levi's
… And I'm just tryna keep my daughters off the pole
And my sons out of jail
Tryna get to church so I don't go to hell
I'm just tryna keep my wife from figuring out
That I married up and she married way, way down
In Alabama where they love Nick Saban
Tryna write a song the local country station'll play
Hey, I'm just tryna stay out of AA
… Ooh
Well I gave up Skoal and cigarettes
Now I'm just hooked on Nicorette
Trying not to be like my old man
But the older I get, the more I am
Tryna get paid and a little love made, y'all
Hey y'all, at the end of the day, y'all
I'm just another John Deere guy (hey)
Up on a tractor
… Tryna steer my daughters off the pole
And my sons out of jail (sons out of jail)
Tryna get to church so I don't go to hell (I don't wanna go)
I'm just tryna keep my wife (hey babe) from figuring out (I love)
That I married up (you're so fine, girl) and she married way, way down
In Alabama where they love Nick Saban (Roll Tide)
Tryna write a song the local country station'll play (I'm just tryna write a song)
Hey, I'm just tryna stay out of AA
… Ooh, ooh, ooh
Come on, bae, right here
… Said, ooh-ooh-ooh, tryna stay out of AA everyday
One step at a time, y'all
Life's hard, family's weird
Sometimes you just need a beer
Can I get an amen (amen)
… Man, I'm just tryna keep my daughters off the pole
And my sons out of jail (sons out of jail)
Tryna get to church so I don't go to hell (I don't wanna go)
I'm just tryna keep my wife (hey babe) from figuring out (I love)
That I married up (you're so fine, girl) and she married way, way down
In Alabama where they love Nick Saban (Roll Tide)
Tryna write a song the local country station'll play (I'm just tryna write a song)
Hey, I'm just tryna stay out of AA
… Oh, hey, hey, hey, I'm just tryna stay out of AA
Yes, I am
